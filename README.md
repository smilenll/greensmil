## AWS Amplify Next.js (App Router) Starter Template

This repository provides a starter template for creating applications using Next.js (App Router) and AWS Amplify, emphasizing easy setup for authentication, API, and database capabilities.

## ⚠️ Environment Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: This project currently uses the **PRODUCTION** Cognito User Pool for local development.

- See `AMPLIFY-CONFIG-NOTES.md` for detailed configuration information
- **DO NOT** change `amplify_outputs.json` user pool ID without reviewing the notes
- Production pool ID: `us-east-2_NpbKvoIJO`

This setup will remain until a dedicated sandbox environment is introduced.

## Overview

This template equips you with a foundational Next.js application integrated with AWS Amplify, streamlined for scalability and performance. It is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart their project with pre-configured AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Setup with Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication (Google OAuth configured).
- **API**: Ready-to-use GraphQL endpoint with AWS AppSync.
- **Database**: Real-time database powered by Amazon DynamoDB.
